The EyeOT project

EyeOT (Eye + IOT - Internet Of Things)

This project was created as part of the "Eyewriter Hackathon" in Tel-Aviv(2014).

The purpose of the project was to create a usable product that utilize 
the Eyecan project (https://code.google.com/p/eyecan/) to control
the components in the user's room using only his/her eyes.


In our demo, we presented the ability to control the Air conditioner using an IR led connected to a
Raspberry Pi. In order to control the A/C, the user could surf to a custom website that supplied a
focus-to-click button that in order to activate the button, the user had to focus on it for several seconds
(This way, we prevented the user from clicking on the button by mistake)


This project is based on the research of
